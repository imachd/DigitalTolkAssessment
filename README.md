**Refactoring**

**Booking Controller**

index: The function checks for the presence of the 'user_id' parameter in the request. If it exists, it calls the repository's 'getUsersJobs' method. Otherwise, it checks if the user is an admin or superadmin and calls the repository's 'getAll' method. The function should have a default response or throw an exception if none of the conditions are met.

show: No refactoring needed.

store: No refactoring needed.

update: Renamed the variable '$cuser' to '$current_user' for better readability. Moved the 'array_except' method outside of the function call and stored the result in a variable before passing it.

immediateJobEmail: Removed unused variable '$adminSenderEmail'.

getHistory: If the 'user_id' parameter exists in the request, the function calls the repository's 'getUsersJobsHistory' method and returns the response. Otherwise, it returns null. The code within the if block was moved outside to avoid nested code.

acceptJob: No refactoring needed.

acceptJobWithId: No refactoring needed.

cancelJob: No refactoring needed.

endJob: No refactoring needed.

customerNotCall: Renamed the function to 'customerNotCalled'.

getPotentialJobs: Removed unused variable '$data'.

distanceFeed:

Used early return for the case of a flagged comment and when 'admincomment' value is empty.
Replaced 'isset' with 'empty' function for checking both existence and emptiness.
Replaced the string 'no' with boolean false.
reopen: No refactoring needed.

resendNotifications: No refactoring needed.

resendSMSNotifications: Removed unused variable '$job_data'.



**BookingRepository:**

Consider separating logic into a separate class (e.g., a service class) to adhere to the single responsibility principle (SRP).
Refactor the class into smaller classes, following SRP.
Use dependency injection instead of using the 'new' operator to create class instances.
Improve code indentation and use early returns where applicable.
Ensure all functions have a default return value or throw an exception when necessary.
Refactor the 'store' function into a separate class with private methods for better readability.
Refactor the 'jobToData' function and create private methods to remove complexity.
Use the 'app()' helper function to resolve instances from the Laravel container for better flexibility and testability.
Use curly brackets for if statements and loops.
Refactor the 'sendNotificationTranslator' function by extracting logical checks into private functions for improved readability.

**Test Cases**

I have added the unit test cases for the willExpireAt method in the TeHelper helper and also added the test case for the repository for the method createOrUpdate in the file UserRepository file.
